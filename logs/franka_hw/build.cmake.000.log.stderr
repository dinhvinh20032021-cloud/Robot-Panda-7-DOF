[31m[1mCMake Error[0m at /home/vinh/ws_moveit/src/franka_ros/franka_hw/CMakeLists.txt:23 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindFranka.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Franka", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Franka" (requested
  version 0.8.0) with any of the following names:

    FrankaConfig.cmake
    franka-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Franka" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Franka_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Franka"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
